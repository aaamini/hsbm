*Hierarchical stochastic block model (HSBM)*

The code implements the algorithm discussed in [Hierarchical Stochastic Block Model for Community Detection in Multiplex Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05330).

The code now relies on the [`nett` package](https://github.com/aaamini/nett) for some of its functionality. 

Try running `benchmark2.R` for a comparison of HSBM with spectral clustering on a simple example.
